// This file is processed and then imported into @hydrogen-design-system/system

// File paths must respect how the system's architecture works.
// - root
//   - core
//     - styles

// Unlike the versioned copy, this stylesheet doesn't require Hydrogen's core because the core is imported by the system itself in that repository later on.
